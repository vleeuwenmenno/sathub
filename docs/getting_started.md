## Setting Up Your First Station

Stations represent your ground station equipment and location.

### Creating a Station

1. Click "Stations" in the navigation
2. Click "Create Station"
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name for your station
   - **Description**: Tell others about your setup
   - **Location**: Enter a rough location (city, region, or country)

### Station Dashboard

Once created, your station gets:
- A unique **Station Token** (keep this secret!)
- Health status monitoring
- Post management
- Settings page

### Station Health

SatHub tracks your station's status through regular health pings. The data client sends a health check every few minutes to let the system know your station is online and operational. If health pings stop, your station will show as "offline" in the directory.

## Sharing Satellite Data

The primary way to share satellite data on SatHub is through automated uploads using the SatHub Data Client. This ensures your station runs 24/7 and automatically shares every satellite pass you capture.

### Prerequisites for Automated Uploads

Before setting up the SatHub Data Client, you'll need:

#### Satdump Software
You'll need satdump (satellite processing software) installed and configured to capture satellite signals. Set it up so it automatically processes satellite passes and saves the output to a directory that the SatHub client can monitor.

**Example setup:** Configure satdump to output processed satellite data to a folder like `/home/user/satellite-data` or `C:\satellite-data` on Windows.

#### What You Need

- The SatHub Data Client software (download from the website)
- Your station token
- Satdump software installed and configured
- A directory where satdump saves processed satellite data

#### Basic Setup

1. **Download the client** for your operating system
2. **Get your station token** from your station settings
3. **Configure the client**:
   ```bash
   # Set your station token
   export STATION_TOKEN=your_token_here

   # Point to your satdump output folder
   export WATCH_PATHS=/path/to/your/satdump/data

   # Run the client
   ./sathub-client
   ```

#### Advanced Setup (Recommended)

For 24/7 operation, run the client as a service:

**On Linux with systemd:**
```bash
# Create service file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/sathub-client.service
```

Paste this content:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=SatHub Data Client
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your_username
Environment=STATION_TOKEN=your_token
Environment=WATCH_PATHS=/home/you/satellite-data
ExecStart=/path/to/sathub-client
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable sathub-client
sudo systemctl start sathub-client
```

#### What the Client Does

The client:
- Monitors your SatDump output folders
- Waits for complete satellite passes to finish processing
- Automatically extracts metadata and images
- Uploads everything to your station
- Moves processed data to an archive folder
